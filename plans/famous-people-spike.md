# Spike: famous people + "at my age" overlay

Status: **spike** — proves the concept end-to-end; not the finished feature.

## The idea (from the brainstorm)

Public data grows, so it shouldn't all render by default. Instead the rail's
"+" menu hides two pickers:

- **🌍 World events** — toggle any bundled `public-data/*.json` dataset on/off.
- **🌟 Famous people** — add a person's biography, optionally shifted so their
  birth lands on *yours*, answering "what did Mozart do at **my** age?"

## What shipped in the spike

- `src/publicData/famous/` — a small catalog (Mozart, Einstein, Frida Kahlo).
  Each `FamousPerson` carries a `birthMs` anchor plus a biography authored in
  the same shape as a public-data file.
- `alignToAge.ts` — the one novel bit: `buildFamousDataset(person, userBirthMs?)`
  shifts every entry by `userBirthMs - person.birthMs`, so a fact at the person's
  age N lands at the calendar date when *you* are age N on the shared axis. Pure,
  unit-tested (`alignToAge.test.ts`).
- Store/actions — `activeWorldKeys` + `activeFamous` selections; nothing loads by
  default (`initializeApp` now seeds `publicDatasets: []`). `toggleWorldEvents`,
  `toggleFamousPerson`, `setFamousAlignment` rebuild `publicDatasets` from the
  selections. Verified end-to-end in `famousPeople.test.ts`.
- UI — `WorldEventsPicker` / `FamousPeoplePicker` submenus in the rail "+" menu.
- **Zero renderer changes**: famous people ride the existing public-dataset merge
  path, so the canvas/rail render them for free.

## Update — round 2 (feedback applied)

- **"At my age" moved to the group header.** A 🎂 toggle on each famous person's
  rail group flips that person between real dates and age-aligned, in place. The
  per-person checkbox in the add-menu is gone. `parseFamousGroupId` recovers the
  person + alignment state from the rendered group id.
- **Multi-row biographies.** Each person is now split into *Places lived /
  Education / Works* (hand-authored) or *Places lived / Education / Career /
  Works* (Wikidata), instead of one combined row.
- **Every entry has an end date.** Open ends render as ongoing arrows, which look
  wrong for a finished life. Hand-authored entries all carry ends; the Wikidata
  mapper synthesises them — open-ended residence → death (or today); point-in-time
  work → +1 year.
- **Wikidata search + dynamic load.** `wikidata.ts`:
  - `searchWikidataPeople` — MediaWiki `wbsearchentities` (`origin=*`, CORS-open).
  - `fetchWikidataBiography` — one WDQS SPARQL query (P551/P69/P39/P108/P800 +
    P569/P570), mapped by the pure, unit-tested `bindingsToPerson`.
  - Picker has a live search box; results add straight onto the timeline.

Verified the **live** endpoints from Node through the real functions: search
returns hits; the SPARQL query returns 200 with sensible ranges for Marie Curie
(Q7186). ⚠️ WDQS **403s a generic/Node User-Agent** by policy — browsers always
send a real UA (WDQS's own GUI is browser-based), so the app path is expected to
work, but this was **not** confirmed in-browser here (extension not connected).

## Update — round 3 (feedback applied)

- **Removal.** An "✕" on every overlay group header removes it — a famous person
  (`removeFamousPerson`) or a world-events dataset (`removePublicGroup` routes by
  namespace). Each famous timeline (row) has its own "✕" (`removeFamousRow`),
  filtered out of the rebuilt dataset via per-person `removedRowKeys`; removing
  the last remaining row drops the whole person.
- **Persistence across reload.** Overlay selections (world keys + the full
  `activeFamous`, including Wikidata-fetched biographies) are stored in the same
  IndexedDB under an `overlays` key and restored in `initializeApp`. Persist is
  debounced and centralised in `rebuildPublicDatasets`, so every add/remove/align
  is saved. Verified end-to-end with fake-indexeddb.

## Update — round 4 (feedback applied)

- **Remove ✕ is hover-reveal** now, like the other rail controls (`.hover-reveal`),
  not always-on.
- **Search filtered to people.** `wbsearchentities` can't filter by type, so we
  now follow it with one `wbgetentities?props=claims` call, read each hit's `P31`
  (instance of), and keep only humans (`Q5`). Both calls are on the CORS-open
  action API (`origin=*`) — no WDQS. "Napoleon" now shows the emperor + Napoleon III
  and drops the given-names, the Ohio city and the video game.
- **🐞 Debug view.** A toggle in the picker opens a panel showing exactly what
  came back and how we read it:
  - the raw search hits, each marked kept/dropped with its `P31` ids and
    description (so you see *why* something was filtered out);
  - for the last loaded person: birth + entry/row counts, our interpreted rows
    and entries with year spans, side by side with the raw SPARQL bindings.

### What the Wikidata API gives us (for reference)

- **Search** (`wbsearchentities`): id, label, description, match — good ranking,
  no type info (hence the P31 follow-up).
- **Biography** (one WDQS SPARQL query): residences `P551`, education `P69`,
  positions `P39` + employers `P108`, notable works `P800`, plus birth `P569`
  and death `P570`. Ranges come from statement qualifiers `P580`/`P582` (start/
  end) or, for works, the work's publication date `P577`. Coverage is uneven —
  many statements have no dates and are dropped; open-ended ranges are closed at
  death/today; point works get a +1yr span.

## Update — round 5 (richer biographies + verified in-browser)

Used Elon Musk (Q317521) as the shaping example. The SPARQL query now also pulls
partners (`P26` spouse, `P451` partner), children (`P40`, dated by the child's
own `P569`/`P570`), and awards (`P166`, dated by `P585`).

- **Overlapping items become sub-row lanes.** Career and Children map to a parent
  header row with one sub-row per item, so concurrent companies (PayPal/SpaceX/
  Tesla/OpenAI/Neuralink/Boring Co. all at once) and siblings growing up in
  parallel each get their own lane instead of stacking. Flat rows (places,
  education, partners, works, awards) keep entries on one row. Lanes capped at 14.
- **Partners & children are sub-timelines, not persons** — exactly as asked; they
  never become Person entities/sub-groups.
- **Removal cascades**: removing a parent row (e.g. "Career") drops its sub-rows;
  a single lane can still be removed on its own.
- **Verified live in a real browser** (localhost:5174): search → filtered to the
  one human "Elon Musk" → add fetched the biography over WDQS, rendered 11 career
  lanes / 14 children / 6 partners / 17 awards, and the group-header 🎂 shifted the
  whole life to "at your age". **This resolves the last open risk — the WDQS
  SPARQL fetch works from the browser** (only Node's default User-Agent was blocked).

## Update — round 6 (compact-collapse of an "area of life")

Parent rows with sub-rows (Career, Children) are now collapsible — but unlike a
group collapse, the sub-timelines **stay on the canvas** and compress into a
dense band, giving an overview of that life area.

- **Rail**: a ▸/▾ toggle on any parent row (replaces its checkbox). Collapsed, the
  rail shows just "Career ▸" — the sub-row labels drop away.
- **Canvas**: the sub-rows stay but render compact — `COMPACT_ROW_HEIGHT` (20 vs
  40), tight `COMPACT_ROW_GAP`, 10px font — and each bar now carries **its row's
  own label** (Tesla, SpaceX) since the rail no longer shows it.
- Implemented as a `compact` flag on `LayoutItem`, inherited down from a collapsed
  parent in `computeLayout` (new `collapsedRowIds` arg). The rail skips compact
  items; the engine draws them shorter with the row label. State is in-memory
  (`collapsedRowIds`) since public rows are read-only.
- **Verified live**: collapsing Career compacts its 11 company lanes into a dense
  labelled band; Children compacts its 14 kids; expand restores full lanes.

## Update — round 7 (preserve Wikidata date precision)

Dates were all imported as `year`, flattening exact birth dates. Now each date is
read from its **value node** (`wikibase:timeValue` + `wikibase:timePrecision`),
so day/month/year precision is kept: Nevada Musk → 2002-05-18 (day), Strider →
2021-11 (month), Griffin → 2004 (year, all Wikidata has). Person birth/death use
the **best-rank** statement. Fixed a bound-variable-name mismatch along the way
(`?birthDate` vs `?birth`) that had been silently dropping the person's birth and
falling back to their first event's year.

Deferred (agreed): **Stage 2** — regroup Career so each company lane holds its
*position* bars (Chairperson/CEO inside Tesla). The data is available — P39
positions carry a `P108` employer qualifier — but positions overlap, so it needs
a third nesting level. Next step, not in this change.

## Deliberate spike shortcuts (not production-ready)

- Static biographies are hand-authored TS, kept out of `public-data/` on purpose
  so they don't have to satisfy the validated public schema (no `birthMs` there).
- No client-side caching of Wikidata responses yet (each add re-queries).
- Alignment requires the user's birth date; the 🎂 toggle is hidden until it's set.

## Still open / next

- Cache Wikidata biographies; read real per-statement date precision.
- Residence/date coverage is uneven on Wikidata (e.g. Musk's early homes are
  missing) — nothing we can fix, but worth surfacing in the UI.
- Awards render as many overlapping point-events on one row; could be tidied.
